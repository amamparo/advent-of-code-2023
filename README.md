# Advent of Code 2023

Or, `Advent of Go`

I will be using Advent of Code 2023 to learn golang and practice TTD.

Each day's directory will contain:
* the go code + tests in a module named after the problem
* the prompt in `README.md`
* the challenge input in `input.txt`
* the challenge answer in `answer.txt`
